# Seven Times Have I Despised my Soul

<!-- more -->

——Kahlil Gibran

The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.

当它本可进取时，却故作谦卑。

The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.

当它在跛足者 面前蹒跚而行。

当它在空虚时，用爱欲来填充。

The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.

在困难和容易之间，它选择了容易.

The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.

它犯了错，却借由别人也会犯错来宽慰自己。

The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.

它自由软弱，却把它认为是生命的坚韧。

The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.

当它鄙夷一张丑恶的嘴脸时，却不知那正是自己面具中的一副。

And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.

唱起颂歌，还以美德自诩。

当它满口道义,却多行不义之事。

它侧身于生活的污泥中，虽不甘心，却又畏首畏尾。
