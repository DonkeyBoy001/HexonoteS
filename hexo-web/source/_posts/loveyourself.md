As i began to love myself

当我真正开始爱自己，

I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only waring signs that i was living against my own truth.

我才懂得，把自己的愿望强加于人，

Even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it,

是多么的无礼，就算我知道，时机并不成熟，

那人也还没有做好准备，

and even though this person was me.

就算那个人就是我自己，

Today I call it RESPECT.

我开始远离一切不健康的东西。

Food, people, things, situations, and everything taht drew me down and away from myself.

不论是饮食和人物，还是事情和环境，

我远离一切让我远离本真的东西。

如此日复一日。这就叫“完美”。

As I began to love myself

当我开始真正爱自己，

I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick.

我明白，我的思虑让我变得贫乏和病态，

But as I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally.

但当我唤起了心灵的力量，

理智就变成了一个重要的伙伴，

Today I call this connection WISDOM OF THE HEART.

这种组合我称之为“心的智慧”。

we no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others.

我们无须再害怕自己和他人的分歧，矛盾和问题，

Even starts colide,

因为即使星星有时也会碰在一起，

and out of their carshing new words are born.

形成新的世界，

Today I know, That is LIFE.

今天我明白，这就是“生命”！
